2003-03-06 : (exodusd@web.de) added support for YUV420P palette:
	- How to use:
	  - Run ./Configure and select the Video4Linux driver
	  - Add "-palette=YUV420P" to your video-config (vconf) parameter
	    in the arVideoOpen( vconf ) call
	    (see examples/simple/simpleTest.c for an example usage...
	    only the vconf variable at the top of the code has been changed)

	- Note: If you are using a Philips ToUCam USB webcam (like the 740K)
	    then you should also install the pwcx module available from
	      http://www.smcc.demon.nl/webcam/
	    this should allow you to use video modes like 640x480...
	    The pwc driver itself should already be part of your linux
	    kernel, but you might also want to download it, because the
	    package will contain header files to access advanced features
	    of the webcam (like white-balance, etc).

	    As some webcams (like the Philips ToUCam 740K) are using an
	    automatical white-balancing you might want to look at their
	    drivers on how to disable this (for the Philips cam, this is
	    in the pwc-ioctl.h header of the pwc-driver...)

	    Also note that the YUV420P to RGB24/32 conversion code is
	    far from optimal, it just converts the image into a temporary
	    image buffer and then uses that image buffer for the ARToolKit
	    routines (much like the Firewire camera code in ARToolKit).
	    This has not been optimized (assembly code with MMX extensions
	    could speed this up on Intel(TM) machines...). It also hasn't
	    been thoroughly tested.

	- Files changed (backups made, with suffix ".orig", you can use
	  diff to see the changes):
	  - lib/SRC/VideoLinuxV4L/video.c
	  - include/AR/sys/videoLinuxV4L.h
	  - all the examples and utils (only modified the vconf variable)

2002-09-19 : original version 2.65 of ARToolKit (from the art02 workshop CD)
