has subsequently been greatly enhanced and expanded by a 'cast of
thousands'.

Most important of all - the 'official' PLIB developers:

  Sebastian Ude
  Steve Baker        <--- Hmmm - must sort this list by SECOND name!
  Will Lachance
  Wolfram Kuss

Then, the non-registered contributors:

  (Apologies to anyone I've left
   out - please let me know who

  Christian Mayer
  Darrell Walisser

Special mention must go to:

  Brian Paul        (Mesa)
  Curtis Olson      (FlightGear guru and all-round "Mr Nice Guy",
                     who nagged me into writing most of this stuff!)
  Vasily Lewis      (Tireless maintainer and sysadmin at Woodsoup
                     where PLIB was first hosted)
  Toru Egashira     (Who wrote a program called 'NSPmod' which was
                     the original basis of the SL 'MOD' player -
                     although the original code has been almost
                     entirely rewritten in the process of merging
                     it with SL.
