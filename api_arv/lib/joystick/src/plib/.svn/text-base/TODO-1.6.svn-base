NEW FEATURES:

Structure section

*	SSG needs RTTI to replace the rapidly vanishing SSG_TYPE bits resource.

*	I'd like to see the FGFS sky model moved into ssgAux so everyone can use
	it.  We got part of the way towards that - but it was never finished.

*	I'd like to have a ROAM engine built into ssgAux for terrain rendering.
	(maybe not *literally* ROAM - but something very like it).

SSG section

*	Support for bump maps, cubic environment maps, etc, etc on hardware
	that supports it.

*	Support for multi-texture.

*	Import some kind of Skin & Bones animation into ssgAux (using the
	ExPoser code - or something even better).


Loader section

*	MORE file readers and writer.
For example, a reader/loader for WWII Fighters would be nice.

*	No file writers for about 2/3rds of the file formats we support.

*	I want the PPE material editor's file format built into SSG so we can
	load and save material lists.

*	Model formats
	* VRML
	* XML version of ssg
	* WWII (I think thats the name)

SG section

*	function to get the angle between two vectors

*	plot points on a vector (walking in a straight line)

*	Expand SG with more intersection and distance-measuring tricks.


PUI section

*	PUI should also be implemented with RTTI as well.

*	Movable widgets

*	PUI is still somewhat tied to GLUT...that should go.  It'll need a
	way to get the window dimensions - and at least one built-in font
	before we can do that.

SL section

*	Re-implement SL on top of OpenAL.

*	Write players for more modern MOD-like music formats.

Examples section

*	More example programs - more complete demo games and tools.

*	More documentation for all the new features.
