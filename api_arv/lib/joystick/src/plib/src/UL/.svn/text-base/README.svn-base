Somehow this 'UL' directory (note uppercase name)
got created on a PC running Windoze - and all efforts
to rename and/or delete it from Linux have failed.

So it remains here as a kind of memorial to things
past.  Since I cannot create a new directory called
'ul' (in lowercase) either, all these files are now
in a new area called 'util'.
