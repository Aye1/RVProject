NOTICE:  The PLIB Portable Interactive Applications Library distribution
contains source code that is released as OpenSource under the GNU
Library Public License. These programs are thus freely distributable
without licensing fees.  These programs are provided without guarantee

If you use PLIB in a commercial or shareware product, it would be nice
if you gave credit where it is due.  If you make any neat modifications
or improvements to PLIB, I would greatly appreciate a copy of the
improved code or at least a source patch.

Note that PLIB uses an addition to the LGPL:

  As a special exception Steve Baker gives permission to link these 
  libraries with proprietary software and distribute the resulting 
  executable without including that proprietary code in any distribution 
  as the LGPL would normally dictate. 
 
  This exception is ONLY granted in the case of an embedded system in 
  which there is no possibility of an end user re-linking or recompiling 
  against new versions of this library that may appear in the future."
