To do a build for OS 8 or 9, just bring up the openal_mac_cw6.mcp project into CodeWarrior and build the 
OpenAL Library target.  To test the new library, build the DemoApp target.  There are Carbon versions of both 
the library and DemoApp which will work fine but are not normally used on OS 8 or 9.
