ASIO Config
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FMOD ignores FSOUND_SetBufferSize in ASIO mode.  It relies on settings 
provided by the ASIO control panel supplied with the driver.  In the tools
directory of the FMOD api, you will find an asioconfig.exe tool which allows
you to configure the ASIO driver by doubleclicking on the appropriate driver.
