This function helps with channel usage.  If you are desperate for channels, and you are prepared to <BR>
let the music routines drop a few channels, then calling this function can help.<BR>
It basically doesnt try to play any new sounds if a certain channel limit is being played (including sound effects),<BR>
and the new sound is below a certain specified volume.<BR>
ie.<BR>
You set it to maxchannels = 16, and minvolume = 0x10. <BR>
In this case, the mod will play normally as long as the total number of channels being played inclusing sound effefcts is below 16<BR>
(see FSOUND_GetChannelsPlaying).<BR>
If the number of channels playing exceeds 16 (through a change in the music, or extra sound effects<BR>
are spawned, then sounds with a musician specified volume of less than 0x10 will be ignored.<BR>
The volume is based on volume column/default volume/volume set commands in the mod.  master volume,<BR>
envelope volumes etc are not taken into account (this gives more control over how it will work from the<BR>
tracker).<BR>

<TABLE>
<TR VALIGN=top><TD><I>mod</I></TD>
<TD>Pointer to the song to set channel/volume optimization settings.<BR>
</TD><TR VALIGN=top><TD><I>maxchannels</I></TD>
<TD>Channel count to be mixed before fmusic starts to drop channels from the song.<BR>
</TD><TR VALIGN=top><TD><I>minvolume</I></TD>
<TD>If maxchannels is exceeded, then music channels with volumes below this value will not be<BR>
played.  Range is 0-64.  This is the value the tracker displays.  All trackers use 0-64.<BR>
</TD></TABLE>
<H3>Return Value</H3>
On success, TRUE is returned.<BR>
On failure, FALSE is returned.<BR>
<H3>Remarks</H3>
maxchannels will default to the number of channels allocated by FSOUND, so this will never happen<BR>
by default.<BR>
minvolume will default to 0, so it will always succeed by default.<BR>
To see how many channels are currently being MIXED, use FSOUND_GetChannelsPlaying.<BR>
As a musician mentioned to me once, most of his default volumes are set fairly high, and any low end <BR>
volumes are usually	echoes etc, and can afford to be dropped.<BR>
