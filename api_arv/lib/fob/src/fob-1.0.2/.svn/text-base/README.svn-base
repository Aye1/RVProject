- Flock of Birds Library 1.0.1

==============
Installing the library should be as easy as:

./configure
make install

You'll probably also want to build the test programs to make sure
everything is working:

cd test
make

This will generate two test programs: "fly" and "fly2".  "fly" simply
outputs received data from the flock to stderr.  "fly2" is an OpenGL
based program which shows you the bird's location/orientation.  Of the
two programs, you should definitely give "fly2" to a try.

Part of the fun of getting your flock to work with the library is
figuring out how long the library should wait between sending 
commands to the flock hardware.  By default the library waits 500ms
between commands.  This is very conservative and a bit slow.  A good
way to find the best wait time for your particular setup is to use
the test program "fly2":

./fly2 -s 250 /dev/ttyS0

The above command tells the library to wait 250ms between sending 
commands to the flock hardware.  To find the optimal wait time, keep 
decreasing the wait time until the the library is unable to initialize
the birds.  Once you've found a bad value, simply use the previous good
value.

It's important to note that this "command wait time" only affects
the amount of time it takes to start up the flock.  It does not affect
the operation of the flock once the "fly( )" has been called.


==============
API documentation can be generated via Doxygen:

doxygen fob.doxygen

This should create a directory named "api" in which you'll find both
html and tex based documentation.
