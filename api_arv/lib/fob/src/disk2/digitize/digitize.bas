PRINT "     will do."
PRINT ""
PRINT "3.   The transmitter will rest at one end of this surface and the"
PRINT "     stylus tip will rotate on the surface one foot in front of  "
PRINT "     the transmitter.  If there is a possibility that the"
PRINT "     transmitter will move during calibration then it should be"
PRINT "     taped or screwed to the surface - use plastic or 300 series"
PRINT "     stainless steel screws.  The stylus tip should be as short"
PRINT "     as possible since any errors in the Bird's angular measure"
PRINT "     will be magnified by the tip length.  For each degree of"
CALL pause

PRINT "     times the tangent of the error angle.  Error angle is 0.5"
PRINT "     degrees root mean square for the Bird) .  If the stylus is"

PRINT "     of the receiver when the stylus is perpendicular to the"
PRINT "     surface."
PRINT ""

PRINT "     Bird's POSITION/MATRIX data at each orientation.  A least"
PRINT "     squares solution is then carried out to solve for the tip"
PRINT "     x,y,z offsets.  Once set up, the data collection takes less"
PRINT "     than one minute."

PRINT "     A typical data collection sequence would be to hold the "

PRINT "     table, then rotate approximately 45 degrees forward, then"
PRINT "     backwards, then left, then right and possibly some other"
PRINT "     angles if experience shows its required.  No fixture is"
PRINT "     required to do the rotations unless you have a very unsteady"

PRINT "     each rotation angle. It is only required to maintain the tip"
PRINT "     of the stylus at the same point on the surface during all"
PRINT "     rotations.  The sharper the tip the better since a blunt tip"
PRINT "     will introduce errors as the stylus is rotated.  If you have"
PRINT "     a blunt tip, then a slight depression in the surface with a"
PRINT "     radius of curvature equal to or slightly larger than the"
PRINT "     tips radius will help maintain the tip at the same x,y,z"
